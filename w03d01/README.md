### Web Servers
* A server listens for incoming requests and responds in some way
* HTTP servers => requests/responses come in over HTTP
* Request / response
* Images, video, text, files, dynamically rendered files
* Every request has two main parts: PATH and METHOD
* METHOD is an instruction to the server: GET, POST
* PATH tells us what resource we are interested in: /users, /maps

GET /users
GET /maps
POST /maps
